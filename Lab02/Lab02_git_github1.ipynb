    "## Step 0: Install git and create a GitHub account\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two things you'll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done that, create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join).  (Accounts are free for public repositoriesand personal private repositories.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Create a local git repository\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new **[repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)** (or often, **repo**, for short).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use git we'll be using the terminal. If you don't have much experience with the terminal and basic commands, check out [this tutorial](http://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/utilities-how-to/how-to-use-terminal-the-basics/) (especially the 'Navigating the Filesystem' and 'Moving Around' sections).\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, open up a terminal and move to where you want to place the project on your local machine using the `cd` (change directory) command. For example, if you have a 'projects' folder on your desktop, you'd do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ cd ~/Desktop\n",
    "$ mkdir myproject\n",
    "$ cd myproject/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the **[git init](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-init)** command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ git init\n",
    "Initialized empty Git repository in ~/Desktop/myproject/.git/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Add a new file to the repo\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a [touch](http://linux.die.net/man/1/touch) command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've added or modified files in a folder containing a git repo, git will notice that changes have been made inside the repo. But, git won't officially keep track of the file (that is, put it in a commit - we'll talk more about commits next) unless you explicitly tell it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ touch ensf400.txt\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "ensf400.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the new file, you can use the [**`git status`**](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command to see which files git knows exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "\n",
    "\tensf400.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this basically says is, \"Hey, we noticed you created a new file called `ensf400.txt`, but unless you use the '`git add' `command we aren't going to do anything with it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### An interlude: The staging environment, the commit, and you\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most confusing parts when you're first learning git is the concept of the staging environment and how it relates to a commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **[commit](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)** is a record of what files you have changed since the last time you made a commit. Essentially, you make changes to your repo (for example, adding a file or modifying one) and then tell git to put those files into a commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commits make up the essence of your project and allow you to go back to the state of a project at any point.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do you tell git which files to put into a commit? This is where the [**staging environment** or **index**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) come in. As seen in Step 2, when you make changes to your repo, git notices that a file has changed but won't do anything with it (like adding it in a commit).\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the **[git add](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) ** command (see Step 3 below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've used the git add command to add all the files you want to the staging environment, you can then tell git to package them into a commit using the [**git commit** ](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)command. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The staging environment, also called 'staging', is the new preferred term for this, but you can also see it referred to as the 'index'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a file to the staging environment using the **git add** command. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the \"Changes to be committed\" line). \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to be committed:\n",
    "  (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "\n",
    "\tnew file:   ensf400.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, the file has **not** yet been added to a commit, but it's about to be.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Create a commit\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to create your first commit!\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the command `git commit -m \"This is my first commit!\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git commit -m \"This is my first commit!\"\n",
    "[main (root-commit) b345d9a] This is my first commit!\n",
    " 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n",
    " create mode 100644 ensf400.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The message at the end of the commit should be something related to what the commit contains - maybe it's a new feature, maybe it's a bug fix, maybe it's just fixing a typo. Don't put a message like \"asdfadsf\" or \"foobar\". That makes the other people who see your commit sad. Very, very, sad.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Create a new branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've made a new commit, let's try something a little more advanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you want to make a new feature but are worried about making changes to the main project while developing the feature. This is where **[git branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is)** come in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. For instance, if you want to add a new page to your website you can create a new branch just for that page without affecting the main part of the project. Once you're done with the page, you can [**merge**](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) your changes from your branch into the main branch. When you create a new branch, Git keeps track of which commit your branch 'branched' off of, so it knows the history behind all the files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you are on the main branch and want to create a new branch to develop your web page. Here's what you'll do: Run **[`git checkout -b `](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)**. This command will automatically create a new branch and then 'check you out' on it, meaning git will move you to that branch, off of the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the above command, you can use the **[`git branch`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)** command to confirm that your branch was created:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git branch\n",
    "  main\n",
    "* my-new-branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The branch name with the asterisk next to it indicates which branch you're pointed to at that given time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you switch back to the main branch and make some more commits, your new branch won't see any of those changes until you [**merge**](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) those changes onto your new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Create a new repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only want to keep track of your code locally, you don't need to use GitHub. But if you want to work with a team, you can use GitHub to collaboratively modify the project's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new repo on GitHub, log in and go to the GitHub home page. You should see a green 'New' button.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After clicking the button, GitHub will ask you to name your repo and provide a brief description.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done filling out the information, press the **Create repository** button to make your new repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub will ask if you want to create a new repo from scratch or if you want to add a repo you have created locally. In this case, since we've already created a new repo locally, we want to push that onto GitHub so follow the **'....or push an existing repository from the command line'** section: \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/mynewrepository.git\n",
    "$ git push -u origin main\n",
    "Counting objects: 3, done.\n",
    "Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 263 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.\n",
    "Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\n",
    "To https://github.com/username/mynewrepository.git\n",
    " * [new branch]      main -> main\n",
    "Branch main set up to track remote branch main from origin.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " (You'll want to change the URL in the first command line to what GitHub lists in this section since your GitHub username and repo name are different.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Push a branch to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll **push** the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo. This allows other people to see the changes you've made. If they're approved by the repository's owner, the changes can then be merged into the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, you'll want to run `git push origin yourbranchname.` GitHub will automatically create the branch for you on the remote repository: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git push origin my-new-branch\n",
    "Counting objects: 3, done.\n",
    "Delta compression using up to 8 threads.\n",
    "Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\n",
    "Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 313 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.\n",
    "Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\n",
    "To https://github.com/username/mynewrepository.git\n",
    " * [new branch]      my-new-branch -> my-new-branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering what that \"origin\" word means in the command above. What happens is that when you clone a remote repository to your local machine, git creates an **alias** for you. In nearly all cases this alias is called \"[**origin**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes).\" It's essentially shorthand for the remote repository's URL. So, to push your changes to the remote repository, you could've used either the command: **`git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname`** or **`git push origin yourbranchname`**\n",
    "\n",
    "(If this is your first time using GitHub locally, it might prompt you to log in with your GitHub username and password.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you refresh the GitHub page, you'll see note saying a branch with your name has just been pushed into the repository. You can also click the 'branches' link to see your branch listed there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now click the green button in the screenshot above. We're going to make a **pull request**!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 8: Create a fork\n",
    "\n",
    "For all other team members, fork your group's main repo. Make a new commit by adding a new file with a name you choose to the repo. For each group member that forks the main repo, push the changes to the forked repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 9: Create a Pull Request (PR)\n",
    "\n",
    "A pull request (or PR) is a way to alert a repo's owners that you want to make some changes to their code. It allows them to review the code and make sure it looks good before putting your changes on the main branch. For all other group members, create a pull request from the forked repo to the main repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might see a big green button at the bottom that says 'Merge pull request'. Clicking this means you'll merge your changes into the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this button won't always be green. In some cases it'll be grey, which means you're faced with a **merge conflict**. This is when there is a change in one file that conflicts with a change in another file and git can't figure out which version to use. You'll have to manually go in and tell git which version to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you'll be a co-owner or the sole owner of a repo, in which case you may not need to create a PR to merge your changes. However, it's still a good idea to make one so you can keep a more complete history of your updates and to make sure you always create a new branch when making changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 10: Merge a PR\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and click the green 'Merge pull request' button. This will merge your changes into the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done, I recommend deleting your branch (too many branches can become messy), so hit that grey 'Delete branch' button as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can double check that your commits were merged by clicking on the 'Commits' link on the first page of your new repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will show you a list of all the commits in that branch. You can see the one I just merged right up top (Merge pull request #1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see the [**hash code**](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-hash-object) of the commit on the right hand side. A hash code is a unique identifier for that specific commit. It's useful for referring to specific commits and when undoing changes `git revert ` command to backtrack).\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 11: Get changes on GitHub back to your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, the repo on GitHub looks a little different than what you have on your local machine. For example, the commit you made in your branch and merged into the main branch doesn't exist in the main branch on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the `git pull origin main`command (when working on the main branch).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git pull origin main\n",
    "remote: Counting objects: 1, done.\n",
    "remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\n",
    "Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), done.\n",
    "From https://github.com/username/mynewrepository\n",
    " * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD\n",
    "   b345d9a..5381b7c  main     -> origin/main\n",
    "Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.\n",
    " ensf400.txt | 1 +\n",
    " 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows you all the files that have changed and how they've changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use the [**`git log`**](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) command again to see all new commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You may need to switch branches back to the main branch. You can do that using the `git checkout main`command.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git log\n",
